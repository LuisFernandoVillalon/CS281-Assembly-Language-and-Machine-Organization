## Divisible.sln
Create the Divisible solution in VS. In main.asm, call the isDivisible procedure once. The isDivisible procedure traverses an array of dword elements and 
determines whether the elements are evenly divisible by val. The number of elements that are evenly divisible by val is captured and returned in EBX. Pass 
all arguments to isDivisible by pushing them onto the stack. In isDivisible use EBP as the base stack pointer.

## Sort.sln
Create the Sort solution in VS. In main.asm, call the sort procedure once. The sort procedure traverses an array of word elements and sorts the elements 
of the array in ascending order. Implement an Selection SortingLinks to an external site. algorithm. Pass all arguments to sort by pushing them onto the 
stack. In sort use EBP as the base stack pointer. In the sort procedure call the findSmallest procedure which returns the index value of the smallest element 
in the array. The smallest element in the array will be swapped with the ith element. Pass all arguments to findSmallest by pushing them onto the stack.
