## Factorial.sln
Create the Factorial solution in VS. In main.asm, call the factorial procedure once. The factorial procedure will recursively call itself 
until the base case is reached. At which point, the winding phase will transition to the unwinding phase and the factorial of a number will 
be returned, through repeated multiplication, in EAX. Pass all arguments to factorial by pushing them onto the stack.
