# Coding Assingment

## ReplaceAll.sln
Create the ReplaceAll solution in VS. In main.asm, call the replaceAll procedure which replaces all instances of a character with another character. 
For example, if the string is "mississipi", and all instances of "i" are replaced with "e", then the string will now be "messesseppe".

## Equals.sln
Create the Equals solution in VS. In main.asm, call the equals procedure which compares two strings for equality. The equals method calls the toLowerCase 
procedure to remove case-sensitivity in the comparison of the two strings. Push and pop registers appropriately when calling procedures that need use the 
same registers as other procedures. 

## CompareToIgnoreCase.sln
Create the CompareToIgnoreCase solution in VS. In main.asm, call the compareToIgnoreCase procedure which compares two strings by comparing the first 
pair of distinct corresponding characters. The comparison is such that the ASCII value of the character of the second String is substracted from the 
ASCII value of the character of the first String.  The compareToIgnoreCase method calls the toLowerCase procedure to remove case-sensitivity in the 
comparison of the two strings. If one of the Strings is a substring of the other String, then the compareToIgnoreCase procedure returns the difference 
in lengths of String one and String two. Push and pop registers appropriately when calling procedures that need use the same registers as other procedures.
