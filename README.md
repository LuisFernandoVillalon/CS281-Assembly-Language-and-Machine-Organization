# CS281-Assembly-Language-and-Machine-Organization
A repository that holds all my programming assignments assigned to me for my Assembly Language and Machine Organization college undergraduate course. 

## Course Description
Basics of machine architecture, machine language, assembly language and operating systems. Representations of data
types and structures along with instruction representation and execution, addressing modes, subroutine calls and return
mechanisms, fixed point systems, and basic organization of the von Neumann machine are included. 

## Course Objective
1. Describe how data is represented in computer memory.
2. Show how fundamental high-level programming constructs are implemented at the machine-language level.
3. Write simple assembly language program segments.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Describe how data are represented in the computer, including floating point numbers and arrays.
2. Code, execute and debug assembly language programs.
3. Demonstrate an understanding of computer architecture.
4. Demonstrate the function of CPU registers.
5. Use correct addressing modes and terminology.
6. Use integer arithmetic instructions.
7. Correctly use repetition constructs, macros and procedures in assembly language.
8. Program keyboard input and text screen output.
9. Use machine instructions involving data structure stacks to code selected algorithms.
